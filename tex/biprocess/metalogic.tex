\section{Meta-logic}

\paragraph{Syntax, semantics}

\begin{itemize}
  \item two new sorts: index and timestamp
  \item interpretation of meta-logic is trace-dependant (vs interpretation of logic is protocol-dependant)
  \item interpretation of index variables in $\mathbb{N}$ (the ones appearing in the trace)
  \item interpretation of timestamps by actions appearing in the trace
  \item atom formulas of the meta-logic
  \begin{itemize}
    \item order $\leq$ on timestamps
    \item define happens(action)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Axioms}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Adrien's axioms are in the logic (not the meta-logic)
  \item which supplementary axioms do we need in the meta-logic?
  \item induction expressed with an axiom in the meta-logic (in order to have variables that will be interpreted in the logic)?
\end{itemize}
