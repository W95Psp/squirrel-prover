.. Squirrel documentation master file.
   This file should at least contain the root `toctree` directive.

The Squirrel Prover is a proof assistant for cryptographic protocols.
It is based on a higher-order version of the Bana-Comon logic,
and provides guarantees in the computational model.

.. note::
   This project is under active development.

.. note::
  This *documentation* is under construction,
  and the documentation framework is still being adjusted.
  Our **TODO**-list includes:

    * Distinguish commands and declarations using separate directives.
    * Decide on a place to document commands such as print, search, etc.
    * Tweak toc and navbar to show (sub)sections.
    * Settle on a convention for documenting errors common to multiple tactics
      (only document the error once, maybe have links from subsequent uses to
      first one).

You are reading the user's documentation.
For a more theoretical perspective on Squirrel,
you may read some of the associated publications:

Below is a README adapted from the Coq documentation,
explaining how to write this documentation.
