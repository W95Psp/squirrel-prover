To create a example in a html file, you need:
- A squirrel file "squirrel_name.sp"
- A html file "page.html" containing the line:
    <!--HERE--> (without spaces or tabulations)

The command (to be launched from the root folder squirrel-prover/):
  ./squirrel examples/[squirrel-file.sp] --html html_output/page.html

This command will create a copy of page.html in the same directory named squirrel_name.html.
This new file will have the output of squirrel formatted in html and placed where the <!--HERE--> tag was.
